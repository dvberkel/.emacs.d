I started using emacs because their was a discrepancy between the
tools I used at work and at home. At the time I used a Mac at work and
a Linux distribution at home. I used different editors and had to
invest time to get the learn them both. It seemed wasteful. So I set
out to learn an editor that was availble on both platform. I
settled for [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]].
